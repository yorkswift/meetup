A warm welcome ðŸ––

---

hello ðŸ‘‹,

Thank you for joining YorkSwift! 

This is a new meetup so I would like to introduce myself and give you a bit of background.

I joined my first meetup in Austin, Texas on November 11, 2011 wanting to learn more about iPhone mobile development.

That was the beginning of that meetup and it has grown into a great community of very talented and knowledgeble developers

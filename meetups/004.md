## Agenda 

### ï£¿ ðŸŽ‰ ï£¿ 

Lets get together to watch the live stream of the Apple Special Event, see what new devices will be coming out for us to develop for! Theres plenty of rumours out there, as always most of us will be hoping for a "...one more thing".

After the stream we can discuss whats been released and those brave amongst us can update all our devices with the latest OS which should be released at the same time.

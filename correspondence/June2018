A warm welcome 🖖

---

hello 👋,

Thank you for joining YorkSwift! 

* 🌎 Background *

This is a new meetup so I would like to introduce myself and give you a bit of background.

I joined my first meetup in Austin, Texas on November 11, 2011, wanting to learn more about iPhone mobile development.

That was the beginning of that meetup and it has grown into a great community of very talented and knowledgable developers.

https://www.meetup.com/South-Austin-iOS-Developers - hi Rob!

I moved back to the U.K. last year and felt like there is a need here in York for something similar.

Where experienced developers & new learners can share their knowledge, insights and learn together.

The York Developers are an excellent group of people with the same goal.

If you are not on the Slack channel already let me know and I can get you added, its a great place to engage with the developers here in York.


* 💻📲 About the meetup *

If you write Swift all day, every day or if you have never written a line of code, my aim is that everyone can learn something by coming along.

I hope to have hands on practical coding sessions, roundtable discussions on best practices, open clinic for your latest bugs
side project spotlight, talks by developers for developers.

I will also have a few meetups for just working on your side projects with the added bonus of peer support.

If you are interested in helping organise or doing a talk please get in touch.

The meetup will be monthly initialy but I hope to make it more frequent in the future.

It's an exciting time in the Swift world with plenty of diverse areas of interest and lots to learn! 

* 🕰️ Next Meetup 🕰️ *

This friday!! (I'll try usually go for the 3rd Tuesday of the month, but could'nt this week)

We will mainly be going over what's new from WWDC18

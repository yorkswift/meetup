A warm welcome ðŸ––

hello ðŸ‘‹,

Thank you for joining YorkSwift! 

* Background *

This is a new meetup so I would like to introduce myself and give you a bit of background.

I joined my first meetup in Austin, Texas on November 11, 2011, wanting to learn more about iPhone mobile development.

That was the beginning of that meetup and it has grown into a great community of very talented and knowledgable developers.

I moved back to the U.K. last year and felt like there is a need here in York for something similar.

Where experienced developers & new learners can share their knowledge, insights and learn together.

The York Developers are an excellent group of people with the same goal.

If you are not on the Slack channel already let me know and I can get you added, its a great place to engage with the developers here in York.


* About the meetup *

If you have never written a line of Swift or you write Swift all day every day, my aim is everyone can learn something.

If you are interested in helping organise or doing a talk please get in touch.
